Dear Chef Danielson, 
Salutations. I hope your day has been pleasant up to this point. In the humblest of manners, I come to you with the goal of receiving a gustatory experience I will not forget anytime soon. While you do provide this on a regular basis already, I request for this one to go outside of the typical parameters to satiate my needs. Although I'm flexible, the following guidelines are preferable in how this experience is tapered to me:
- I hope for my taste buds to be chased down, viciously assaulted, then consoled and nursed back to health by the items specified above. 
- I'd like my tongue to be waterboarded in flavor until its pulse stops, tongue-CPR to be performed until it comes back to tongue life, then for it to be liberated from Tongue Guantanamo Bay and returned to its homeland. 
- I request my mouth be taken from its family at night while sleeping, be blindfolding and transported in the back of a van to an unknown location where it be roughly interrogated under an ominously swinging light, after which it be rescued by Mouth Tom Cruise and sent on an all expenses-paid trip to Tahiti. 

While I understand these above options are not regularly included on the menu due to their unusual nature (and legal liability), I do appreciate your flexibility in accommodating everyone's dietary need. We wouldn't be able to do it without you! 

With gratitude,
Schuyler Krawczuk
Chief Executive Client, Taking Pure Joy

If any of these are at all spicy (hot spicy), is it possible to leave out the spice (as our boys are very fussy with spice), thanks so much!
